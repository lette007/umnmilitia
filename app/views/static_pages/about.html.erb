  hi, i’m looking for people to pitch my website (launching 01/2017) in front of lecture halls

the website is a platform to fundraise for Against Malaria Foundation, a nonprofit that distributes insecticide-treated mosquito nets to people in places affected by malaria. there are over 50,000 students at the U, and if each of us give a penny a day (add $1.00 to our account every 100 days) we can protect over 2000 people a day from overnight malaria contraction. malaria kills over half a million people a year and causes suffering in over 400 million, and this is all preventable. 

the site (when finished) will allow students to sign up with their @umn.edu email (only umn emails can sign up) and add $1.00 to their accounts .. once the user count reaches 250, we’ll start subtracting $0.01 * total # of users from the fund every day and donate that to Against Malaria Foundation. 

pictures of email confirmations of donations (and possibly bank account ledgers) will be posted on the group’s facebook page


potential pitch for website:     

(please improvise as much as you want)


Who here has ever wanted to be a superhero?


*hands raise*


Ok, well who here has ever wanted to be Wonder Woman or Superman?


*hands raise*

Awesome .. and does anyone know superman and wonder woman’s real names?

*Clark Kent / Diana Prince

Right, nice ..  – so what makes diana prince and clark kent superheroes?


*answer from audience or your own explanation (laser vision, fly, superhuman strength)*

Right .. right .. nice –but now i want you to imagine a different situation .. – so what if clark kent and diana prince .. before they started fighting crime and saving the day .. what if they met at some airport .. like midway airport in Chicago .. and what if there was this intense extraterrestrial chemistry between them .. and they just hit it off full steam .. like a romantic rocket ship .. like they just found the nearest closet n got it on full steam ahead .. and they were just like “why are we paying for these flight tickets?” .. “fuck it.. let’s just buy some sky blue jump suits and facemasks and travel the world together for the rest of our lives.. .. get away from all this violence…” .. and what if then .. we never found out about their superpowers .. would they still be superheroes .. would we still have the chance to call them superheroes?? throw them on tv screens and newspapers? ..  

what i’m trying to say is that .. what makes superman and wonderwoman superheroes is the fact that they save lives

and then supervillains are the ones that kill innocent people and cause suffering …

so i’m up here because there are over 50,000 students at the University of Minnesota .. and together we have the potential to be a very powerful superhero

but why do we need a superhero? ------- because there’s a supervillain that goes mostly unnoticed to us … but it’s pretty powerful .. and we’re trying to stop it

and the supervillain is malaria .. and it kills over 500,000 people a year .. and it causes suffering in over 400 million a year 

that’s obviously bad news, but there’s good news too …. and the good news is that there’s a superhero called the Against Malaria Foundation that’s been fighting Malaria for over a decade .. and by using insecticide treated mosquito nets .. they’ve protected over 30,000,000 people from overnight malaria contraction

and so i call them a superhero

and their superpower is the ability to distribute these insecticide treated mosquito nets .. 

and our superpower .. if we want to be a superhero .. is to pay for these insecticide treated mosquito nets .. and there are over 50,000 students at the University of Minnesota .. and if we come together .. we can protect over 2000 people a day from malaria .. at a cost of one cent a person .. because we can all afford to give at least one cent a day .. 

and if we each give one cent a day, that’s $500 dollars a day .. which pays for 200 mosquito nets 

so we can save over 200 lives a day and it will cost us each as close to nothing as you can possibly get .. and that’s a superpower .. 

so .. how do we become a superhero?

first, we come together as a cohesive unit

and where do we do that?

online
